## 🔥 About Bridge Sources

This project tests bridges from [this](https://github.com/scriptzteam/Tor-Bridges-Collector) repository, which is:
- A **very large archive** of various bridge types
- **Slow to update** - may not change for months

Despite the source's infrequent updates, daily testing remains valuable for:
Maintaining a verified working list and healthy bridges show little variation between daily runs


**For fresh and new bridges**, please check our dedicated collection repository:
 [Delta-Kronecker/Tor-Bridges-Collector](https://github.com/Delta-Kronecker/Tor-Bridges-Collector)
